In the runModel.py file, there is a parameter labeled num_review (on line 81) where 
you can adjust the number of IMDB review to be pass into the model. My function will print out
the review, the prediction, and the predicted probability that the review is positive and negative.

The reviews will be taken directly from the imdb_reviews dataset and will be shuffled randomly each
time the code is executed. 

Thanks!
